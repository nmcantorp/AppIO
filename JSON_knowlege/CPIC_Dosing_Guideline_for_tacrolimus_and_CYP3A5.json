However, in the case of CYP3A5 and tacrolimus, a CYP3A5 expresser (i.e. CYP3A5 extensive metabolizer or intermediate metabolizer) would require a higher recommended starting dose and the CYP3A5 non-expresser (i.e. poor metabolizer) would require the standard recommended starting dose.<br/><sup>b</sup> Additional rare variants such as <em>CYP3A5*2, *8</em>, and <em>*9</em> may be found which are of unknown functional significance. However, if a copy of <em>*1</em> is present, expected phenotype would be intermediate metabolizer.<br/><sup>c</sup> This recommendation includes the use of tacrolimus in kidney, heart, lung and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, and liver transplant patients where the donor and recipient genotypes are identical.<br/><sup>d</sup> Further dose adjustments or selection of alternative therapy may be necessary due to other clinical factors (e.g., medication interactions, or hepatic function)<br/><sup>e</sup> Rating scheme is described in 2015 Supplement.</p>"
