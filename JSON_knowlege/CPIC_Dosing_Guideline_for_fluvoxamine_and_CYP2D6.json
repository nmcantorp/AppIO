For individuals with CYP2D6 duplications or multiplications, see supplemental data for additional information on how to translate diplotypes into phenotypes. <br/><sup>d</sup> Data are lacking describing the effect of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolism on fluvoxamine therapy; therefore no dosing recommendations are provided for fluvoxamine use for of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers.
