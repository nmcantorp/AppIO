Because there are insufficient data to calculate an initial citalopram or escitalopram dose for CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers, an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 may be an option if deemed appropriate given other medications and clinical considerations.\"</li><li>\"Elevated concentrations of these drugs have been observed in poor metabolizers, which may increase the risk of adverse drug reactions. To potentially prevent an adverse effect, an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 should be considered. If citalopram or escitalopram is warranted an initial dosage decrease of 50% should be considered. For citalopram, the FDA recommends a 50% dose reduction (or a maximum dose of 20 mg/day in adults) for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers due to risk of QT prolongation (the FDA recommendation does not apply to escitalopram).\"</li><li>\"The recommendations in the guideline and below apply primarily to actions based on genetic tests only; drug interactions and other clinical factors can have a major influence for prescribing decisions for SSRIs and should be taken into consideration before initiating drug therapy.\"</li><li>\"Data describing the relationship between CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 genotype and SSRI systemic exposure or steady state plasma concentrations in pediatric patients are scarce...CYP2C19 activity may be increased in children relative to adults; therefore, these recommendations should be used with caution in children and accompanied by close monitoring.\" </li></ul></li><li>Download and read: <ul><li><a href=\"/download.do?objCls=Attachment&amp;objId=SSRI_CPIC_accepted_version_fromCPT.pdf\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes and Dosing of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</a></li><li><a href=\"/download.do?objCls=Attachment&amp;objId=SSRI_supplement_revised_final_R2_05112015.pdf\">2015 Supplement</a></li><li><a href=\"/download.do?objCls=Attachment&amp;objId=CYP2C19_SSRI_translational_table_posted.xlsx\">2015 CYP2C19 SSRI translation table</a></li><li><a href=\"/download.do?objCls=Attachment&amp;objId=CYP2C19_Frequency_Table_and_Legend_V1.pdf\">CYP2C19 frequency table legend</a></li><li><a href=\"/download.do?objCls=Attachment&amp;objId=CYP2C19_frequency_table_V1_posted.xlsx\">CYP2C19 frequency table</a></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=\"Table1DosingrecommendationsforcitalopramandescitaloprambasedonCYP2C19phenotype\">Table 1: Dosing recommendations for citalopram and escitalopram based on CYP2C19 phenotype:</h3><p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 3a of the 2015 guideline manuscript.</em></p><table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed table-hover table-bordered\"><tr><th>Likely phenotype</th><th>Genotypes</th><th>Examples of CYP2C19 diplotypes</th><th>Implications for citalopram/escitalopram metabolism</th><th>Therapeutic Recommendations</th><th>Classification of recommendations <sup>a</sup></th></tr><tr><td>Ultrarapid metabolizer (~5-30% of patients) <sup>b</sup></td><td>An individual carrying two increased function alleles or one normal function allele and one increased function allele</td><td>*17/*17, *1/*17</td><td>Increased metabolism when compared to extensive metabolizers.
