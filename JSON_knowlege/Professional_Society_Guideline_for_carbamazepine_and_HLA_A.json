In patients who have previously taken CBZ for a shorter period, genetic testing should be considered (B)...In patients who are positive for HLA-B*15:02 or HLA-A*31:01, alternative medications should be used as first-line therapy (A). Consideration in the choice of alternative medications should be given to the possibility of cross-reactivity with structurally simiar AEDs (oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, phe- nobarbital, primidone).</p></blockquote>"
