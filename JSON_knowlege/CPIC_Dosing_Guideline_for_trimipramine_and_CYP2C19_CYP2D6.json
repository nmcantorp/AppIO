  "summaryHtml" : "<p>Tricyclic antidepressants have comparable pharmacokinetic properties, it may be reasonable to apply the CPIC Dosing Guideline for amitriptyline and CYP2C19, CYP2D6 to other tricyclics including trimipramine. In the guideline for amitriptyline, an alternative drug is recommended for CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers and for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Consider a 50% dose reduction for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and a 25% dose reduction for CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.</p>",
